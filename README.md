# Data Structures and Algorithms

Data structure and algorithms are an integral part of computer science. All the enthusiasts, at some point in time, learn these two important topics. They are different yet very much interrelated topics. This interrelation brings out the big question that needs to be answered: **"What should I learn first â€“ data structures or algorithms?"**

Before understanding what is the first priority for you to learn, it is a must that you learn what is a data structure and what is algorithm first.

## What is Data Structure?

A `data structure` is the mathematical or logical model of an organization of data. In short, a data structure is a way to organize data in a form that is accessible to computers. It allows the processing of a large amount of data in a relatively short period of time. The main purpose of using data structures is to reduce time and space complexities. An efficient data structure makes use of minimum memory space and takes the minimal possible time to execute.

## What is Algorithm?

Algorithms are well-defined sets of instructions designed that are used to solve problems or perform a task. To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.
